# Smart Contract Example: Functionality with require(), assert(), and revert()

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that serves as an example to demonstrate the usage of `require()`, `assert()`, and `revert()` functions in Ethereum smart contracts.

## Contract Overview

The `ContractWithFunctions` smart contract showcases three fundamental functionalities for writing secure and robust Ethereum smart contracts: 

1. **require():** Used to enforce conditions that must be met for a function to proceed. The contract's `setValue` function uses `require()` to ensure the new value being set is greater than the current value.

2. **assert():** Utilized to verify internal consistency within the contract's logic. The `assertExample` function confirms that the denominator is not zero before performing a division operation.

3. **revert():** Employed to handle exceptional cases or invalid inputs. The `revertExample` function utilizes a `revert()` statement to halt function execution if the provided amount exceeds the current value.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to deploy and interact with the smart contract:

1. **Compile the Smart Contract:**

   Compile the smart contract using your preferred Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle, solc).

2. **Deploy the Smart Contract:**

   Deploy the compiled contract to an Ethereum-compatible blockchain network. You can use tools like Remix, Truffle, or deploy through a development framework.

3. **Interact with the Contract:**

   - Use the `setValue` function by sending a transaction from the contract owner's address to set a new value.
   - Call the `assertExample` function by sending a read-only transaction to perform a division operation.
   - Call the `revertExample` function to test the revert functionality by sending a read-only transaction with an amount.

## Prerequisites

- Solidity Compiler (v0.8.0 or compatible)
- Ethereum Wallet or Development Environment

## Usage Example

```solidity
// Deploy the contract and interact with its functions
